# NixOS and home-manager Configuration

This repo contains the configuration files for my laptop and desktop.
My laptop runs NixOS!!
My desktop runs Arch linux and uses only home-manager. Most of the configuration is with home-manager so it doesnt make much of a difference.

This configuration is managed using flakes. They are very cool.

## Current programs used:
|                      |           |
| -                    | -         |
| Window Manager       | bspwm     |
| Hotkey daemon        | xbindkeys |
| Status bar           | polybar   |
| Terminal emulator    | Alacritty |
| Editor               | Neovim    |
| Shell                | zsh       |
| Prompt               | starship  |
| Application launcher | rofi      |
| Notification daemon  | dunst     |
| pdf reader           | zathura   |
| Browser              | firefox   |

Note there may be configuration for programs that I don't use, and they are probably there from me trying out those programs.

i might explain how i use the programs later idk
